# Welcome to OpenHexa!

The documentation for OpenHexa notebooks is here: https://github.com/BLSQ/openhexa/wiki/Using-notebooks-in-OpenHexa

Please note that:

- You can't create files or directories at the root of the filesystem
- The `workspace` directory is where most of your work should happen
- The `tmp` directory is a temporary directory (see https://github.com/BLSQ/openhexa/wiki/Using-notebooks-in-OpenHexa#the-tmp-directory)
